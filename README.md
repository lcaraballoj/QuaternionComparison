# Introduction
The goal of this project is to be able to compare the compute time of various math methods and concepts to calculate the rotation of a 3D object given three random angles. These include using Euler Angles and matrices to get out a rotation matrix, and quaternions to get a quaternion describing this rotation. The hypothesis is that quaternions will be faster to compute over a large set of data.
